## Timeframe

We were given 8 days to complete our group project. Initially, we conducted research and crafted a wireframe using Trello. We then utilised Trello to allocate tasks, identifying the areas we wanted to tackle first. As a collective effort, we began by working on the backend server, with everyone contributing together. Subsequently, we divided responsibilities for the frontend server among the team members.

## Planning

This was the wireframe our group and I created before commencing our project. We had the freedom to design it according to our preferences. Our wireframe was well-structured, outlining the various pages and routes we intended to incorporate.

## Build / Code Process

Day 1 – We began by creating the wireframe and conducting research to gather names and recipes.

Day 2 – We initiated the coding for the backend server of our project. This included working on the seeds and establishing the routes for the website.

Day 3 – With the backend server well-structured, we transitioned to developing the frontend and began assigning tasks and responsibilities among the team. On the first day, my responsibility was to create the single Recipe page, where only the clicked recipe would be displayed.

In the section below, we've outlined the structure for the reviews on the single recipe page.

Day 3 - We began working on authentication and added some styling to our page.
We started to get the code done for the login User and Register user, using the async function.

Day 4 - We designed the error page for our site and focused on enhancing the styling, completing pages that were already functional but lacked the desired aesthetic.

Day 5 - We achieved our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). At this point, our focus was on refining the user experience by eliminating errors in our pages and completing any remaining items. 
We started to have issues with our review code. Me and Tamanna started to console log the errors for we be able to have a deep look into and found the probelm and resolve it.

Day 6 - We encountered an issue with the upload link for adding pictures to the project. As a group, we resolved the problem, and soon after, all pages were fully functional again. 
For resolve this problem, we started to console log the functions for have a better look about the errors.
After located where was the error, we implement better the Cloudinary code for make be able to the person upload the picture.

Day 7 - We completed our project and successfully deployed it.

## Challenges

I believe the most significant challenge for us was working in a group, as none of us had prior experience in such a setting. Once we organised ourselves and realised that tackling difficult problems as a group made things easier, the project flowed more smoothly.

My personal challenge was implementing the review feature—being able to display it on the page and enabling only the user who wrote it to delete it. Initially, I thought it would be simpler, but after encountering a few issues with the code, everything started functioning as intended.

## Wins

I believe this project, involving both backend and frontend servers for the first time, was highly rewarding. I successfully incorporated all the ideas I had in mind, thanks to the collaboration within the group.

The most significant accomplishment for me was the review feature, as mentioned earlier. Implementing it required extracting data from another file to generate random reviews and calculate an average, which added a unique and challenging aspect to the project.

## Bugs

The most significant bug I encountered was related to the review functionality, which initially wasn't working. Apart from this issue, our website is currently free of any other bugs.

## Improvments

Enable users to modify their password, username, or email.
Implement a liking and disliking feature for dishes.
Provide users with the capability to add videos.
Incorporate a one-click sharing functionality for users.
